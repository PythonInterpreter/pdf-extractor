EDITORIAL
Global warming presents a huge challenge in all areas of our lives and economic
activities.
ANDRITZ is aware of this and acting accordingly. With our custom-tailored products
and solutions for renewable energy sources, decarbonization, electromobility, the
circular economy and alternative proteins, we help our customers all over the world
to achieve their sustainability goals.
ANDRITZ is also working very hard on reducing the company’s own CO footprint and
2
becoming climate-neutral in the long term. As part of our sustainability program
“We Care”, we have defined ambitious goals in terms of reducing direct and indirect
CO emissions, water consumption and waste volumes.
2
MORE know-how, innovative technologies and greater efficiency result in LESS CO
2
emissions. We see this in our customer projects and also when we implement internal
sustainability measures. In the following pages, we report on how ANDRITZ is pushing
decarbonization forward with its products in close partnership with its customers.

The 21-meter-high tower on the premises of Rohrdorfer
Zement in Upper Bavaria doesn’t look very impressive at
first sight. But it contains something quite sensational:
Germany’s first CO capture plant for cement production.

The facility was built in close collaboration with ANDRITZ
and captures two tons of carbon dioxide per day. But
that is only the beginning. Helmut Leibinger, head of
the Net Zero Emissions team, and Günther Wunsam,

“ We want to achieve
CO savings of

65 percent by 2030.”
Mr. Wunsam, the German cement industry wants to
achieve climate-neutral production by 2050. What is
next on the agenda at Rohrdorfer?
GW We want to be faster than that and aim to decar-
bonize our production by 2040. This is ambitious, but
I believe we are on track. In 2022, we were producing
cement here with 45% less CO than in 1990. This
2
succeeded because we optimized the types of
cement and use of the fuels. We want to achieve
savings of 65% by 2030. The remaining 35% of the
CO will be used as a valuable resource – which
2
brings us to our pilot plant.
How are you going to do this?
GW In principle, the carbon in the CO can be further

processed to produce methanol, ethylene or formic
acid. In this way, products can be obtained that are
mainly produced today using mineral oil. So the
bottom line is, if we look at and use CO as a source

MORE INNOVATION
The Brazilian company Klabin has started up an innovative sulfuric acid plant supplied by ANDRITZ – SulfoLoop enables the production
of commercial-grade sulfuric acid from the mill’s odorous gases. This solution is completely new to the pulp and paper industry.
LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
SulfoLoop strongly supports Klabin in its circular economy initiatives. By producing sulfuric acid in-house, the costs for externally purchased sulfuric acid
are much lower. In addition, indirect CO emissions are reduced: Fewer truck journeys are needed to transport sulfuric acid to the mill.

The term circular economy is often mentioned when talking
about sustainable modernization of industrial production.
And it is also an ecological idea to close material and energy
loops completely and so skillfully that energy input, emissions
and waste are reduced to a minimum – ideally coming close
to zero in the final stage. But how can this good idea become
reality?
At the Ortigueira mill operated by pulp and paper maker
Klabin in southern Brazil, we can observe how operations
are drawing closer to the circular economy step by step. Here,
the first plant in the pulp industry worldwide will produce
commercial-grade, concentrated sulfuric acid from concen-

At the moment, around 100 tons of high-purity sulfuric acid
are being produced per day. This figure is to increase by
another 50% in the course of 2023. The plant will then supply
the sulfuric acid essential to the pulp production process to

Braga says that the plant has several advantages: First

is used to replace the purchased sulfuric acid, it allows the
mill to recycle more streams containing sulfur and sodium,
avoiding effluents. “And thirdly, we can reduce truck trans-

Donawitz, a district in the city of Leoben in Styria, has been
making a living from iron ore for almost an eternity. Iron was
also produced from the iron ore here 500 years ago. On an
area the size of 21 soccer fields, voestalpine Stahl Donawitz

With a new plant design to homogenize steel, ANDRITZ has
been helping voestalpine Wire Rod Austria GmbH on one
leg of this journey. In steel production, homogenization means
the process to provide the raw material with consistently
high quality. To put it simply, the steel is heated to a tem-
perature that gives it a homogeneous microstructure at the
atomic scale. “We can look back on many years of successful
collaboration with ANDRITZ on different projects,” Axel

“ ANDRITZ supports
the steel industry on
the road to producing
CO -neutral steel.”
2
The furnace is an important element in the long-term goal
of decarbonization in steel production. More and more com-
panies are planning to produce CO -neutral steel in the
2
future with the aid of green hydrogen, and this gas is also
seen as an energy carrier of the future in other branches of
industry. The Hydrogen Council for example, a global initia-
tive by leading companies, expects production of green
hydrogen to increase from 0.7 million tons a year in 2020 to
300 million tons in 2050. In addition, the European Union is
promoting further development of innovative hydrogen tech-
nologies as part of the Green Deal. ANDRITZ is actively
accompanying and shaping this development – as a sup-
plier of electrolyzers to generate green hydrogen from renew-
able sources like wind, solar or hydroelectric energy, as a
manufacturer of systems for highly automated fuel cell pro-
duction, or as a partner for new burner solutions (H -ready

In spite of the rapid rise of renewable energy sources sources,
for example wind power, biomass, solar power and geo­
thermal heat, hydropower is the largest source of renewable
energy, with a share of just over 50 percent. And it has
several advantages: Hydroelectricity can be generated
flexibly and accordi ng to needs. Hence, the power grids can
be stabilized and enormous quantities of volatile wind and
solar power, which are not available on demand, can be
stored with the aid of pumped storage power stations.
In regions where the demand for energy will increase
most rapidly in the next few years – such as Asia, South
America and Africa – new large­scale plants will be built
and there will be numerous smaller hydropower projects.
However, there is also enormous potential in Europe and
North America to resolve the “trilemma” of secure supply,
sustainability and affordability of energy. Approximately half
of the plants there are over 40 years old. Modernizing and
upgrading them can make a substantial contribution to the
energy supply.

GREATER EFFICIENCY
ANDRITZ has delivered a biosolids processing facility with a large drum dryer to the US environmental company Synagro and the city
of Fort Worth, Texas. The plant will dewater 1.2 million gallons/day of liquid digested sludge and produce 110 tons/day of fertilizer granules.
LESS CO
2
Dried granules have a higher solids density and lower volume of water than those produced by belt filter presses, which results in a significant reduction in the weight of the final
product. Hence, the CO emissions associated with trucking the dried biosolids have dropped by more than 70%. But that’s not all: Starting in 2024, the dryer facility will be fueled

largely by biogas (digester gas) from the nearby wastewater treatment facility. This will further reduce the carbon footprint associated with biosolids processing operations.

170 years ago, Fort Worth, Texas, was a tiny,
dusty outpost of the US Army. Today, almost
a million people live in the city – and the
population is growing. ANDRITZ is helping
to process the ever-increasing volume of
wastewater by converting residuals into
fertilizer – while at the same time reducing
carbon emissions from biosolids operations.
Modern wastewater treatment plants purify waste-

7,200 liters of wastewater are treated per second
at the Village Creek Water Reclamation Facility.
Fort Worth, Texas, is an expanding city. Almost one million
people live and work there, and there are only twelve larger
cities throughout the USA. But as a city becomes more
attractive to live in, the challenges it faces also increase.
For example, when it comes to water management. It doesn’t
often rain in North Texas, and high temperatures above
40° C are not unusual in summertime. Thus, water is precious
in Fort Worth.
The topic of wastewater has correspondingly high
priority for the city authorities. In the Village Creek Water
Reclamation Facility on the Trinity River in Fort Worth, more
than 7,200 liters of wastewater are treated per second before
being discharged into the river. During the dry months, the
treated water can account for up to 95% of the river flow. In
order to maintain river life and protect the river’s function as
a source of drinking water, optimum operation at the Village
Creek Water Reclamation Facility is a must.
This also applies to the treatment of biosolids, a
byproduct of the wastewater treatment process that
contains nitrogen, phosphorus and other important nutrients.
95%
Fort Worth’s priority is to beneficially reuse this valuable
material, but do so in an innovative and economically
prudent manner. Therefore, the city partnered with the US

“We are currently saving
about 200,000 US dollars per
month in operating costs.”
Synagro selected ANDRITZ to design, manufacture and
deliver a plant that produces dried granules from the liquid
sludge. The ANDRITZ high-performance decanter centri-
fuges dewater the liquid sludge and directly feed one of the
largest and most efficient drum dryers in the world, evapo-
rating up to 14 tons of water per hour. The dryer features a
specially designed back-mixing system producing high-
quality, homogeneous granules that are free of bacteria and
pathogens, so-called “Class A biosolids”. The dried sludge
granules are taken away on trucks and marketed by Synagro
as first-class fertilizer.
Less volume, less CO

This solution also provides the city with several economic and
ecological advantages. “At the moment we are saving around
200,000 US dollars a month in operating costs compared to
operations with belt filter presses,” says Chris Harder, Director
of the Fort Worth Water Department. “These savings will
increase substantially upon completion of the new biogas

Dried granules (Class A biosolids) made from liquid sewage sludge are very
suitable as fertilizer (left), which is in demand in agriculture in the USA (right).
“A biosolids master plan was completed in late 2018 and
includes a detailed analysis of how to best handle Fort
Worth’s biosolids for the next 20 years,” Chris Harder con-
tinues. One big advantage of direct thermal sludge drying
is that the granules have a much smaller volume than the
wet sludge, which results in a significant reduction in the
weight of the final product. “Hence, the CO emissions from

trucking activities have been reduced by 70%,” explains Chris

carbon-neutral fuel, this will significantly reduce the overall
carbon footprint of the biosolids processing facility.
Synagro takes a similar view of the project: “We are
