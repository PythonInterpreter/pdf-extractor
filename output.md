Building networks to connect
Canadians since 1880
Bell has been leading the way building and supporting networks of the
future for more than 141 years. our unrelenting focus began with the
telephone, building networks that connected Canadians within their
community, across the country and around the world. using that same
relentless passion today, our Bell team builds networks that support the
most advanced Internet and wireless technologies in the world.

OUR PURPOSE
BCE’s purpose is to advance how Canadians connect with each other and the world. Our strategy builds on our longstanding strengths in networks,
service innovation and content creation, and positions the company for continued growth and innovation leadership. Our primary business
objectives are to grow our subscriber base profitably and to maximize revenues, operating profit, free cash flow and return on invested capital
by further enhancing our position as the foremost provider in Canada of comprehensive communications services to residential, business and
wholesale customers, and as Canada’s leading content creation company. We seek to take advantage of opportunities to leverage our networks,
infrastructure, sales channels, and brand and marketing resources across our various lines of business to create value for our customers and
other stakeholders.
Our strategy is centred on our disciplined focus and execution of six strategic imperatives that position us to deliver continued success in a
fast-changing communications marketplace. The six strategic imperatives that underlie BCE’s business plan are:
Bell’s
Build the Drive growth with Deliver the most
six strategic
best networks innovative services compelling content
imperatives
Engage and invest in
Champion Operate with agility our people and create
customer experience and cost efficiency a sustainable future
In 2022, we embedded our focus on creating a more sustainable future directly into our six strategic imperatives, reflecting our long-standing
commitment to the highest ESG standards. As one of Canada’s largest companies, we are driven to continually improve our impact and our contribution
to society with our connectivity commitments, investments in mental health initiatives, environmental sustainability and an engaged workplace.
(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a total of segments measure, and adjusted net earnings and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See section 11.3, Total of segments measures and section 11.1,
Non-GAAP financial measures in this MD&A for more information on these measures.
(2) Effective January 1, 2021, we changed our wireless operating metrics to reflect our revised approach to reporting wireless subscriber units. Consequently, we are now reporting in two
categories, mobile phone subscriber units and mobile connected device subscriber units (e.g. tablets, wearables and mobile Internet devices). Additionally, mobile connected device
subscribers now include previously undisclosed Internet of Things (IoT) units (e.g. connected telematics services, monitoring devices, connected cars and fleet management solutions).
These changes are consistent with the way we manage our business, reflect our focus on mobile phone subscribers and align to industry peers. As a result, previously reported 2020
subscribers and associated operating metrics (gross and net activations (losses) and churn) have been restated for comparability. See section 11.6, KPIs, in this MD&A for more details.

1.3 Key corporate developments
This section contains forward-looking statements, including relating to our capital expenditure acceleration program and certain of our ESG
objectives. Refer to the section Caution regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of this MD&A.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ACCELERATION PROGRAM
In 2021, Bell commenced its program to accelerate the rollout of its broadband fibre and wireless networks with a $1.7 billion acceleration
in capital expenditures over the next two years to help drive Canada’s recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. Enabled by a positive investment
climate reflecting government support for infrastructure development, this $1.7 billion capital expenditure acceleration is in addition to the
approximately $4 billion in capital expenditures that Bell has typically spent each year on network infrastructure and expansion over the last
decade, and will significantly increase the connections in localities across Canada. Bell spent approximately $800 million of this additional capital
expenditure in 2021 to deliver approximately 1.1 million new direct fibre and WHI locations and expand mobile 5G coverage to more than 70% of
Canadians. In 2022, our capital expenditures will include $900 million in accelerated capital expenditures to reach up to 900,000 more homes
and businesses with direct fibre connections, expand the reach of our national 5G network to more than 80% of the national population, further
densify our wireless network with new 5G sites to meet growing customer usage requirements, and enable the launch of a 5G standalone core
leveraging 3500 MHz spectrum that will drive enhanced speeds, lower latency and enable next-generation services.

ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL HIGH-VALUE 3500 MHZ WIRELESS SPECTRUM
Bell acquired significant additional mid-band, flexible-use 3500 MHz wireless spectrum – critical to enabling the full potential of 5G –
in ISED’s Canadian spectrum auction completed in July 2021. Bell acquired 271 licences in a number of urban and rural markets for 678 million
MHz-Pop of 3500 MHz spectrum for $2.07 billion. Essential to Canada’s ongoing transition to 5G communications, these high-capacity airwaves
extend Bell’s leadership in delivering enhanced 5G digital experiences to Canadian consumers and businesses in urban, rural and remote
communities. This acquisition increases Bell’s total 3500 MHz spectrum holdings to 1,690 million MHz-Pop.

businesses in Québec and parts of Ontario. As part of its commitment to provide Québec residents with fast and reliable telecommunications
services now and in the future, Bell invests heavily in network infrastructure and expansion throughout urban and rural Québec. Under Bell,
EBOX will benefit from the resources, scale and access to the technology needed to support the growth of the business and continue delivering

million in cash, $400 million available under our securitized trade receivable program and $2.8 billion available under our $3.5 billion committed
bank credit facilities, and an investment-grade credit profile, providing the company with a solid financial foundation and a high level of overall
financial flexibility. BCE has an attractive long-term debt maturity profile with no material maturities until the first quarter of 2023. We continue
to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to lower our cost of debt and optimize our cost of capital. We seek to proactively manage
financial risk in terms of currency exposure of our U.S. dollar-denominated purchases, as well as equity risk exposure under BCE’s long-term
equity-based incentive plans and interest rate and foreign currency exposure under our various debt instruments. We also seek to maintain

(1) Effective Q4 2021, we are no longer reporting mobile phone blended average billing per user (ABPU). Instead, we are reporting mobile phone blended ARPU in order to align with industry
peers. Mobile phone blended ARPU is calculated by dividing wireless operating service revenues by the average mobile phone subscriber base for the specified period and is expressed
as a dollar unit per month.
(2) Effective January 1, 2021, we changed our wireless operating metrics to reflect our revised approach to reporting wireless subscriber units. Consequently, we are now reporting in two
categories, mobile phone subscriber units and mobile connected device subscriber units (e.g. tablets, wearables and mobile Internet devices). Additionally, mobile connected device subscribers
now include previously undisclosed IoT units (e.g. connected telematics services, monitoring devices, connected cars and fleet management solutions). These changes are consistent with
the way we manage our business, reflect our focus on mobile phone subscribers and align to industry peers. As a result, previously reported 2020 subscribers and associated operating
metrics (gross and net activations (losses) and churn) have been restated for comparability. See section 11.6, KPIs, in this MD&A for more details.

REVIEW OF THE CRTC’S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR NORTHWESTEL
On November 2, 2020, the CRTC launched a proceeding to review the regulatory framework for Northwestel and the state of telecommunications
services in Canada’s North. This proceeding may result in modifications to the current regulatory framework for Northwestel, including with
respect to issues such as rates, wholesale access and subsidies. Modifications to the current regulatory framework may result in additional
subsidies and rate flexibility for Northwestel, which would encourage investment, or they may result in rate restrictions or additional wholesale
obligations, which would undermine incentives for investment in the North. At this time, it is unclear what impact, if any, the results of the
proceeding could have on our business and financial results.

10 Accounting policies
This section discusses key estimates and assumptions that management has made and how they affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and notes. It also describes key changes in accounting standards and our accounting policies, and how they affect
our financial statements.
We have prepared our consolidated financial statements using IFRS. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of
measurement uncertainty as those discussed in this section, are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements.
See Note 2, Significant accounting policies, in BCE’s 2021 consolidated financial statements for more information about the accounting
principles we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.
